  PyCity Schools Analysis

  Using pandas :panda_face: we were able to exercise various methods. 
Adding count totals, then Grouping We then got to do some percentages. We then show all this in a school summary to show which is district and charter. 
Further down we start looking at the budgets of those schools next to their test averages. Clearly, schools with a higher budget had a larger size but did not always out outperform the smaller sized schools. Larger schools were mostly district. Smaller charter schools, even with less money. Perform just as well, and in some cases better.


  Closer summaries of Top and bottom percentages: 

  Charter schools have a sweet spot low number of children. Per student. Budget is higher. In turn they're passing % looks great. Students are not stuck in a district were just a bunch of kids in the same block going to the same place because they live close to each other. You can imagine economic - grouping plays big part what a district school could look like. What kind of influences and state of mind some of the neighbors might share? Versus the charter schools’ parents are usually searching, taking an active role in their kids’ education. Meaning there's probably some expendable income there. when the boots not on your neck you got time to do some things. In turn these kids probably have a home bias when it comes to the weight of education, influences etc... all play a part. 
  
Clearly my public school failed me. As I can't. figure out how to fix my Summary table “Scores by school spending”. But that one small table aside. “Scores by size” and “overall summary of scores” by type, reiterates what we thought all along. Charter schools perform better. And they have a higher overall passing... the goal of a school is not to get to 100 there must be a standard in place. However, with 50% overall passing rate from the district school shows us that there's a lot of distractions there. Not everybody in class may see education as a priority. Or maybe that larger classroom is not helping our quick to loses interest types… Also, Districts takes a heavy hit in % passing Math. Clearly spending ranges and additional columns are trouble in the public school.  Says yours truly. 

Thank you for your time.
